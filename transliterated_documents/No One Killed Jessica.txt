Wahan hote na  toh gand phatke haath mein aa jaati
Everybody is somebody in Delhi  nobody is a nobody
Justice has been denied  you can live with it, I will not
Taqat sirf taqatwar logo ke pass hoti hai  aam aadmi ke pass hoti hai, toh bas usse sehne ki aadat
Log kehte hai Mumbai is about money  but Delhi is about power
